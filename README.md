Approach to appearance-based face representation and recognition

The goal of this project is to implement 2-dimensional PCA of image matrix and use k-Nearest Neighbor classifier to classify the images to a specific subject. Each subject has set of photos taken in different illuminated conditions and different facial expressions.
2-dimensional PCA is also used to create a reconstructed image which is approximately same as the original image.
